# My Portfolio
This is my personal portfolio website built with NextJS, showcasing my skills and experience as a web developer. <br/>
It's still in the development phase.

### Technologies:

Frontend:
- [NextJS](https://reactjs.org/) : A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): A superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing.
- [Shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/): Beautifully designed components that you can copy and paste into your apps. Accessible. Customizable. Open Source.
- [Aceternity/ui](https://ui.aceternity.com/): Copy paste the most trending components and use them in your websites without having to worry about styling and animations.
- [Radix](https://www.radix-ui.com/): An open source component library optimized for fast development, easy maintenance, and accessibility. Just import and goâ€”no configuration required.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.

Build Tools:

- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/): The design tool where napkin sketches become digital masterpieces (and everything in between).

### Description:

This portfolio website is still under development, but it will eventually include:

- Showcases my web development projects
- Showcase my photography skills


I'm using NextJS to create a dynamic and interactive user experience.
TypeScript ensures code clarity and maintainability.
Tailwind CSS provides a utility-first approach to styling, making development efficient.

In a near future I'd like to:

- Add smoother animations/transitions
- Add projects in the "see more" section
- Improve performance



Stay tuned!

As I continue to develop this portfolio, I'll be adding more content and functionality. <br/>
Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or feedback.
