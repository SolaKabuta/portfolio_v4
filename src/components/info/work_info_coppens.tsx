                During my internship at <span className={'underline font-bold'}>Mobil Studio</span> as a web developer, I had the opportunity to work on this website
                project, which allowed me to apply and expand my skills in WordPress development and web integration. I
                was responsible for building the website from A to Z, showcasing my ability to manage and execute a web
                development project independently. <br/> <br/>

                {/*I used WordPress as the CMS and Elementor to bring the designs to life, ensuring visual consistency and*/}
                {/*responsiveness. And I implemented custom coding to optimize speed, ensure cross-browser compatibility,*/}
                {/*and integrate necessary plugins. <br/>*/}
                {/*<span className={'font-bold'}>Key Achievements</span> <br/>*/}
                {/*- Responsive Design: Developed a fully responsive website for optimal viewing on all devices. <br/>*/}
                {/*- SEO Optimization: Improved the site’s visibility on search engines. <br/>*/}
                {/*- Performance Optimization: Enhanced the site’s speed and overall user experience. <br/> <br/>*/}

                This project reinforced my technical skills and underscored the importance of effective communication
                and collaboration. It stands as a testament to my ability to handle full-cycle web development projects.
